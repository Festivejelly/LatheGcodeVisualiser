# Lathe Gcode Visualiser
A simple utility to visualise 2D lathe gcode generated by Nano ELS system by Maxim Kachurovskiy https://github.com/kachurovskiy/lathecode

You can try out the visualisation tool here https://festivejelly.github.io/LatheGcodeVisualiser/

Existing features:

- Simulate Gcode.
- Control panel for sending movement and tool change commands.
- Quick Tasks for performing common simple operations such as profiling, facing and threading.
- Planner for building up complex jobs using simple tasks that can be be generic or specific.

Features I want to add:

- Websockets communication with the controller.
- Gcode generator.
- Live visual representation of gcode movements.
- Enhancements to gcode simulation to show tool shape and part shape.
- Cloud storage for settings, jobs and tasks. (Google Drive, One Drive)
