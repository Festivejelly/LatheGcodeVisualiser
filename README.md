# Lathe Gcode Visualiser
A utility to visualise 2D lathe gcode generated by Nano ELS system by Maxim Kachurovskiy https://github.com/kachurovskiy/lathecode
and a tool to control your lathe and perform simple and complex tasks by sending commands over serial and soon websockets.

You can try out the visualisation tool here https://festivejelly.github.io/LatheGcodeVisualiser/

Existing features:

- Simulate Gcode.
- Control panel for sending movement and tool change commands.
- Quick Tasks for performing common simple operations such as profiling, facing and threading.
- Planner for building up complex jobs using simple tasks that can be be generic or specific.

Features im working on now:

- Enhancements to gcode simulation to show tool shape and part shape.

Features I want to add in the future:

- Websockets communication with the controller.
- Gcode generator based on conversational programming.
- Live visual representation of gcode movements when being executed.
- Cloud storage for settings, jobs and tasks. (Google Drive, One Drive)
